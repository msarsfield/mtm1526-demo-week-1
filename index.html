<title>Intro to Javascript</title> <!--if you put your <script> tag in the head it delays rendering the page (slows the loading), but if you put them at the bottom, you can see material as it loads).  Also, we would not be able to manipulate our HTML.  The only Javascript that goes at the top is modernizer and selectiveizer goes at the top, everything thing else goes at the bottom.-->
